### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ibrahim, a computer scientist who loves building heavy mathematical things. Previously I developed many web based applications and now I deliver solutions in machine learning, vehicle routing problems and other mathematical scientific things!

ðŸ”­ Here's a few technologies I've been working with, recently:

Deep Learning | NLP | Python, Keras | *nix | Docker & DevOps | DigitalOcean, GCP, AWS | Node.js, PHP, C# | SQL, NoSQL | Cryptography | Html / Css / Js
